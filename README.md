CS-Principles-Projects, By Donald Winkelman

A collection of projects I worked on while taking AP CS Principles. This includes a Wordle Guessing program and a Stock Market Investment Simulator, the two biggest projects. I may work on these two projects in the future and add a functional GUI and Web User Interface.
